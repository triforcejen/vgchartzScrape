This branch is currently unsuppprted check tuvtran for a more up to date repo, however there may still be something of worth here.
vgchartzfull is a python script based on BeautifulSoup.
It creates a dataset based on data from 
http://www.vgchartz.com/gamedb/

The dataset is saved as vgsales.csv.

You will need to have BeautifulSoup added.
It can be installed by pip.

sudo pip install BeautifulSoup4

There is a delay of 15 seconds per game scraped so prepare to leave this one running overnight!
